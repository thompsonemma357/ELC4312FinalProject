# ELC4312FinalProject
This is Emma Thompson's Final Project for ELC 4312.

In this project, Emma expanded on Pong Chu's Vanilla MMIO system incorporating the microphone peripheral in slot 4. This project reads an input from the microphone in PDM, converts it to PCM, measures the amplitude of the signal, and output whether it is above or below a certain threshold. This is meant to mimic the loud sounds found inside of a central energy plant, and when it reaches aboce a certain threshold, it alerts you to wear ear protection.

All SystemVerilog, XSA, constraint, C++, and header files are included in the github repository. An explanation of the interfacing and design of this project can be found in the report on canvas.
